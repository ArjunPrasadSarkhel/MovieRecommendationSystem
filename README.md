# Movie Recommendation System Engine
![MovieImg](image.jpg)

## A content-based recommendation engine, which will recommend the user movies based on similar content

### The cossine similarity matrix (named as - similarity.pkl), is deployed on azure-blob storage, and it's retrieved from there, hence the app takes 5min when it's started for the first time
### I also have used docker container so it will be ready to deploy anywhere on the web.
